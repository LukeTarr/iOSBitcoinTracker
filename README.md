# iOSBitcoinTracker
A Bitcoin price checker for iOS made in Swift 5

Uses the https://apiv2.bitcoinaverage.com/indices/global/ticker/BTC API and parses returned JSON to find current asking price of Bitcoin.

Built with Swift 5, Cocoapods, Alamofire, and SwiftyJSON.

# What I Learned
This project solidified my knowledge of designing user interfaces for the iOS platform, as well as using third-party Cocoapods to enhance my applications with libraries. I also learned how to request data from an API, and handle JSON responses in order to display that response to the end user.
